## About Accurics

The adoption of cloud native infrastructure such as serverless,  containers, and service mesh are enabling organizations to deliver  new innovations to market. Unfortunately, over 30 billion records  have been exposed in cloud breaches over the last two years and  the velocity of these breaches continues to accelerate. Traditional  cloud security approaches are becoming untenable for securing transient cloud native infrastructure. 

Accurics provides a fundamentally new approach for protecting  cloud native infrastructure by embedding security during  development to establish a secure posture and maintaining it through runtime. The Accurics platform detects and remediates  policy violations as well as potential breach paths across  Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It maintains the secure posture by  monitoring cloud native infrastructure in runtime and assessing  changes for risk. Developers are notified about legitimate changes and the code to update the IaC is checked into the repository for review. In contrast, developers are notified about risky changes and  the code to revert to the secure baseline is provided so that they can  reprovision the cloud and eliminate the change. Establishing IaC as the single source of truth for risk posture enables immutable security.
